# PlanetsAtmosphereSwiftUI

I recently stumbled upon this [chart](https://i.redd.it/24qp49sbvk241.jpg) on [r/coolguides](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/e5wace/graphic_about_the_atmosphere_on_different_planets/) about planets and their atmosphere and I wanted some quick and fun SwiftUI project to demo the framework to my friends. So I just adapted the chart in a simple SwiftUI app.

Here is how it looks :
